A high-school teacher led Canary to climate change and environmentalism. Canary decided to devote his life to the highest orders of problems to work on. From his perspective, none of the people working on other major problems will have more time on the clock if we fail to address climate change.", "His first degree was an undergraduate in sociology, but this didn\u2019t lead in an obvious direction. Canary went to Torino, Italy for a fascinating educational program at the Politecnico di Torino, Italy\u2019s oldest polytechnic school, one established in 1859. The program featured a week each with multiple scientists, stepping through every presentation that they\u2019d made in the mode of Socratic dialogue. Subjects included integrated aquaponics, recycling t-shirts, and bio-digester experiences from around the world. This led to Canary working hard to get into a good project, and JP Morgan was involved in major carbon credits efforts. Then the Colombian Las Gaviotas project called. It was a major reforestation program under way in areas formerly occupied by FARC guerrillas, but they wanted to turn the pilot into something scaled by a factor of 10. Canary worked on the economics of how much would it cost to put 20,000 people in the region for months, it was proposed, and then the president of the country rejected it as it would cost so much as to likely destabilize the economy.", "Canary stayed in Colombia, finishing his MSc Engineering at Universidad de La Sabana, and founding a company. His Spanish wasn\u2019t strong, and he\u2019s still humble about it, but he finished an advanced degree with all lectures in Spanish.", "His startup, Biosystems, spent three years learning how to effectively feed food waste from grocery stores and the like to black soldier flies, whose larval stage is high in proteins and fats, then cook them and turn it into animal feed. The insight was that a lot of oceanic calories was turned into fish meal for the process and their modeling suggested it could rise from $600 per ton to $2,500 per ton, making insect-based protein a commercially viable product. In fact, it did reach over $2,000 per ton. The firm stood up a factory with Vietnamese equipment and four research teams from the university, and published an influential blog of its findings and process. At one point, every major player in the industry was referencing Canary\u2019s blog and findings, leading to a Canadian firm, Enterra, eventually acquiring Biosystems.", "After Canary\u2019s time integrating Biosystems into Enterra, he shifted gears and went differently global with Vestas. A three-day, zero-sum game hiring process was taxing, but he cleared the hurdle with 34 other hires into the program. They sent the new people all over the world on 8-month rotations. Canary started out in Portland, Oregon in the sales team, an easy slide into the program. The next stop, however, was Beijing under the VP of construction, where he was responsible for clearing out a storage yard with a massive collection of surplus unused wind turbine components, a legacy of the often challenging and incomplete key performance indicators of China\u2019s transformation. He was rotated out before the Olympics and its massive air clean up measures, so he experienced the full extent of China\u2019s coal-fired air quality programs, something he credits with giving him a head start on understanding the variance in climate impacts globally.", "He was enthused about China\u2019s tree planting program, something covering an area size of France with over 38 billion trees by 2018. It had been started to reforest areas stripped of trees by Mao-era policies, and to assist in cleansing northern China\u2019s air. Canary considers it to be absolutely what the world needs, and as for its downsides of monoculture and other challenges, his mantra is \u201cDon\u2019t talk smack about anything people are doing to solve climate change.\u201d He thinks that the repurposing of 60,000 of China\u2019s army as tree planters is the kind of thing the US should be considering, with the National Guard and Army Corps of Engineers likely more useful as a climate change adaptation force than many of the things that they do today. His perspective includes not only China\u2019s Great Green Wall, but a similar project in Africa, and the Great Plains Shelter Belts during the Dust Bowl in the US in the 1930s, a Roosevelt initiative. And he\u2019s concerned that some of those lessons from the US\u2019 past are being lost as massive farming organizations maximize acreage at the expense of trees.", "But despite running a tree planting company, and having worked on a massive tree planting program in Colombia for JP Morgan, Canary doesn\u2019t claim to be an expert on trees. In his words, DroneSeed, and hence Canary himself, are good at integrating the expertise of a lot of people from different areas. This includes military drone experts, people with PhDs in silviculture, people with masters degrees in post-fire ecology, people from the nursery sector, and of course people from the software sector. DroneSeed knits together a lot of expertise to put the right seeds in the right places with the right protection as quickly and efficiently as possible, and Canary defers to the experts in his organization.", "The conversation shifted to how he decided on megadrones dropping seeds. ", " is another book Canary recommends. He spent a bunch of time crafting ideas rapidly and putting them in front of people. Time after time he was shot down, and told not to waste the next five years of his life on the subject. Finally, there was the inevitable conversation with a friend in a bar where they told him that he was going to end up as a dirty hippy, planting trees.", "A light bulb went off, and he started exploring the world of tree planting in the United States. Colombia had a much more developed program than any in the US, but the ground was flat. In Canada, it\u2019s students who plant trees. In the US, it\u2019s H1B visa entrants from south of the border. Tree planting wasn\u2019t an easily automatable process even a decade ago.", "Early efforts involved dumping seeds from helicopters or bombing areas with one- to two-year-old seedlings dropped out of C17s, both of which involved massive wastage and lost seeds. As Canary asks, how do you prevent it from being a big squirrel buffet? Seed is a valuable resource, and there isn\u2019t enough of it. Fires are destroying trees faster than seedlings can be grown in the US right now. Canary talked to many technical innovators who had tried everything over the preceding decades, including a 1970s seedling machine gun prototype.", "The problem statement that DroneSeed has solved is how to avoid shocks to the seeds or seedlings, how to avoid predation, how to get them in the right place, how to get them there quickly, and how to keep them from drying out. Hence, precision agriculture from drones.", "And hence the first check from the a small group of angel VCs who shared Canary\u2019s vision.", "In the second half of the discussion, Canary and I talk a lot more about the drones, the process and the challenges, along with the unique FAA certification DroneSeed has to fly swarms of 8\u2032 diameter hexacopters weighing over 100 pounds out of line-of-site of the two operators.

How things change with time and more context! Let\u2019s stroll back a little bit, though, and examine some of the bigger changes from quarter to quarter and year to year.", "Most notably, there was the jump in the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2018, which most people seemed to assume was impossible. Tesla reached levels of production, and thus sales, that were actually called \u201cimpossible\u201d a few years prior and even a few months prior. Actually, such claims were prevalent up until the point that Tesla released its quarterly sales figures. That big production and delivery bump is also what allowed Tesla to become profitable. There was a widespread assumption at the time that those quarters would be a peak period for Tesla sales, and that Tesla\u2019s profitability wouldn\u2019t last. (Of course, that was never an assumption among Tesla bulls, but it certainly was among many critics of Tesla, and I think also among the general public when they knew anything at all about Tesla \u2014 based on my limited conversations with people outside of \u201cEV world.\u201d) The reasoning was that Tesla had delivered vehicles in the second half of 2018 to the many Americans and Canadians who had reserved a Tesla Model 3 over the course of the previous 2\u00bd years and that the delivery total was not in line with a sustainable level of consumer demand.", "Elon Musk and team said that wasn\u2019t the case, that Tesla had no issues with demand, and that the limiting factor to bigger sales was production capacity. Regarding the dip in 2019 that followed, it should be noted that Tesla started shipping Model 3s to Europe at that time, which led to a chunk of deliveries lagging until the next quarter. Also, there may have indeed been a bit of a boom-bust situation in the US at the time because of the US federal tax credit for Tesla buyers beginning to phase out (the credit ", "). In any case, though, a few weeks worth of vehicles were on their way from the US to Europe when the first quarter ended, resulting in that odd drop you see in Q1 2019. And any potentially short-term demand dip that occurred in the US was quite quickly overcome by word of mouth and people just getting more familiar with the Tesla brand and Tesla vehicles cruising the streets around them.", "I\u2019ll take this opportunity to show not just the overall quarterly sales chart, but also quarterly charts and graphs broken out by model. You can see interactive charts and graphs on the bottom of this article, but they tend to not show well on mobile devices, so I encourage you to revisit this piece on a \u201cnormal computer\u201d if you are reading on your phone right now. Otherwise, here are static versions of the charts and graphs:", "Much to the chagrin of those of us who like to track Tesla sales (and I\u2019d say that\u2019s approximately 100% of Tesla bulls and bears), Tesla decided to bundle Model 3 & Model Y sales when the Model Y came out, as well as Model S & X sales when they basically became a minor sideshow compared to the blazing, mass-market models. I think it\u2019s easy to assume why Tesla combines models like this when reporting official global stats, and the rationale makes sense (but it\u2019s still annoying). Tesla has been dealing with high levels of misleading media hype and social media trolling since 2017, if not earlier. Elon Musk knew that if Tesla reported dropping Model 3 sales (deliveries) as the Model Y ramped up, the media and Wall Street would start to hyperventilate about \u201ccollapsing Model 3 sales,\u201d and that could be harmful to the company \u2014 and just plain annoying. With approximately 76% of the parts shared, much of the production capacity for these two models is shared, and demand aside, in order to start bringing the Model Y to market, Tesla had to reduce Model 3 production. Also, the Model Y crossover is the preferred body style and size for many consumers today, so it was sure to be the model many buyers chose once it became available. Nonetheless, if you look closely, based on a large variety of sources and a few assumptions of my own, after a notable dip in the first half of 2020 that was COVID-related, the Model 3 rose again and it has not gone below the Q3 2020 delivery total since then. Is approximately 110,000\u2013120,000 quarterly deliveries a sustainable global demand level?
